# Recommendation System 
Recommendation engines usually produce a set of recommendations using either collaborative filtering or
content-based filtering. The difference between the two approaches is in the way the recommendations
are mined. Collaborative filtering builds a model from the past behavior of the current user as well as
ratings given by other users. We then use this model to predict what this user might be interested in.
Content-based filtering, on the other hand, uses the characteristics of the item itself in order to recommend
more items to the user. The similarity between items is the main driving force here.
